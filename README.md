# Aleadotric

Oxford Languages lists the definition of "aleatoric" as

> relating to or denoting music or other forms of art involving elements of random choice (sometimes using statistical or computer techniques) during their composition, production, or performance.

*Aleadotric* takes the chance-driven, tuneful texture of a windchime and adds colorful animations that help visualize the sound you're hearing.

## Technology Used

This web application was built using React with Vite. I used [p5](https://p5js.org/) for the animations and [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io/) to generate audio in the browser.

The website is continuously deployed from the master branch via Netlify.
